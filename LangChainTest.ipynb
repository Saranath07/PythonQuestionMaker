Here are some tips to help you improve your Python programming skills:\\n\\n1. **Start with the basics**: Make sure you have a solid understanding of the basic syntax, data types, variables, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming concepts in Python.\\n\\n2. **Practice, practice, practice**: The best way to learn Python is by writing code. Start with simple programs and gradually move on to more complex ones. Practice solving problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeWars.\\n\\n3. **Work on projects**: Apply your knowledge by working on real-world projects. This will help you identify areas where you need to improve and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete your projects.\\n\\n4. **Learn from others**: Read open-source code, participate in online communities like Reddit\\'s r/learnpython, and join online forums to learn from others and get feedback on your code.\\n\\n5. **Use a Python IDE**: A Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm, Spyder, or Visual Studio Code can help you write, run, and debug your code more efficiently.\\n\\n6. **Read documentation and tutorials**: The official Python documentation and tutorials are an excellent resource to learn Python.\\n\\n7. **Take online courses**: There are many online courses and tutorials available that can help you learn Python. Some popular options include Codecademy, DataCamp, and Coursera.\\n\\n8. **Join online communities**: Join online communities like Reddit\\'s r/Python, Stack Overflow, and Python subreddit to connect with other Python programmers, get help with your code, and learn from their experiences.\\n\\n9. **Read books**: There are many excellent books on Python programming that can help you improve your skills. Some popular options include \"Python Crash Course\" by Eric Matthes, \"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python\" by Al Sweigart, and \"Python for Data Analysis\" by Wes McKinney.\\n\\n10. **Participate in coding challenges**: Participate in coding challenges like Google Code Jam, Facebook Hacker Cup, or Python Challenges to test your skills and learn from others.\\n\\n11. **Learn advanced topics**: Once you have a solid foundation in Python, focus on learning advanced topics like decorators, generators, asynchronous programming, and machine learning.\\n\\n12. **Stay up-to-date**: Python is a rapidly evolving language, and new libraries, frameworks, and tools are being developed all the time. Stay up-to-date by following Python blogs, attending conferences, and reading newsletters.\\n\\nRemember, getting good with programming in Python takes time, effort, and dedication.

      "(Note: I'll only ask questions when you ask something, and then provide a Python problem statement based on your interest)\n",
      "Congratulations on India's World Cup win, Saranath! That must have been an exciting moment for you! As a cricket enthusiast, I'm sure you must have been following the tournament closely. Do you have a favorite player or team in the Indian cricket team?\n",

      "Now, let's talk about Python's map and filter functions. These functions are used to process iterables and return a new iterable with the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "The `map()` function applies a given function to each item of an iterable (such as a list or tuple) and returns a list of the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "The `filter()` function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example of using `map()` and `filter()`:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "def square(x):\n",
      "    return x * x\n",
      "\n",
      "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
      "squared_numbers = list(map(square, numbers))\n",
      "print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
      "\n",
      "def is_even(x):\n",
      "    return x % 2 == 0\n",
      "\n",
      "even_numbers = list(filter(is_even, numbers))\n",
      "print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, here are some practice questions for you:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with the squares of all even numbers in the original list.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Write a Python function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list with all strings that contain the word \"hello\".\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with the sum of all numbers in the original list.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with the squares of all numbers that are greater than 5 in the original list.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Write a Python function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list with all strings that start with the letter \"A\".\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use the `map()` and `filter()` functions to solve these problems. Good luck!\n",
      "List methods are an important part of Python programming. Let me give you a problem statement and some test cases to help you practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Problem Statement:**\n",
      "\n",
      "You are given a list of cricket players with their scores. Write a Python function to find the players who have scored above a certain average score.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Test Cases:**\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "players = [('Rohit', 50), ('Dhoni', 60), ('Kohli', 70), ('Pant', 40), ('Rahane', 30)]\n",
      "average_score = 50\n",
      "expected_output = [('Rohit', 50), ('Dhoni', 60), ('Kohli', 70)]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Hint:** You can use the `filter` function and list comprehensions to solve this problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it's your turn to write the Python function. I'll wait for your response!\n",
      "Here's a Python problem statement based on your interests in cricket and list methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Problem:** You have a list of cricket players, each represented as a tuple containing their name, batting average, and bowling average. Write a function that filters this list to include only players with a batting average greater than 40 and a bowling average less than 30.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:**\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "players = [\n",
      "    (\"Sachin\", 45.67, 22.11),\n",

      "    (\"Kumble\", 37.11, 21.45),\n",
      "    (\"Tendulkar\", 48.67, 25.23)\n",
      "]\n",
      "\n",
      "filtered_players = filter_players(players)\n",
      "print(filtered_players)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Expected Output:**\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "[(\"Sachin\", 45.67, 22.11), (\"Kohli\", 50.23, 28.45), (\"Tendulkar\", 48.67, 25.23)]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Test Cases:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. `filter_players([(\"Sachin\", 45.67, 22.11)])` -> `[(\"Sachin\", 45.67, 22.11)]`\n",
      "2. `filter_players([(\"Kohli\", 40.23, 28.45)])` -> `[]`\n",
